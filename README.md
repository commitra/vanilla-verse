# VanillaVerse – The Pure JavaScript Playground

**VanillaVerse** is an open, beginner-friendly collection of fun and educational **Vanilla JavaScript projects** — designed to help developers learn, experiment, and contribute safely to real projects without the overhead of frameworks.

It’s a **hands-on learning space** for exploring front-end fundamentals, collaborating with others, and contributing meaningfully to open source — all using **just HTML, CSS, and JS**.

Perfect for **Hacktoberfest**, **first-time contributors**, and anyone who wants to sharpen their web basics in a supportive community environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone or fork the repository.
2. Open the project in VS Code (or your favorite editor).
3. Run a local HTTP server for testing (recommended: **Live Server** extension).
