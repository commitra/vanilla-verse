Thank you for contributing! This project is beginner-friendly and follows an Issue â†’ Assign â†’ PR workflow. For more details, see the sections below on code style, reporting issues, and our Code of Conduct.



## Ways to contribute
- Pick a project from the hub (`index.html`) and open its folder in `projects/vanilla-verse`.
- Read the local `README.md` and `main.js` of projects for TODO markers.
- Open an issue to ask questions or propose a change.

## Development setup
1. Use VS Code with the Live Server extension (recommended) or any static HTTP server.
2. Open `index.html` and ensure links to projects work.
3. Make small, focused changes.

## Commit and PR guidelines
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Title PRs clearly (e.g., "Snake: Add keyboard controls" or "Todo: Persist to localStorage").
- Link related issues, and check the "good first issue" label when appropriate.
- Ensure HTML/JS syntax passes basic validation (no console errors on load).

### Issue â†’ Assign â†’ PR flow (enforced)

To keep work organized and make it simple for maintainers to triage contributions we follow this flow and enforce it via a repository check:

1. Create an issue describing the change you want to make. Use the provided issue templates when appropriate. Alternatively, get alloted in an existing issue. 
2. A maintainer (or you, if given permission) assigns the issue to someone. The assignment signals ownership and helps avoid duplicate work.
3. Open a pull request that references the assigned issue in the PR body (for example: `Closes #12`, `Fixes #12`, or include `#12` somewhere in the PR description).

Our CI includes a check that requires PRs to reference an existing issue that is already assigned. If you open a PR without a referenced assigned issue, the check will fail and a maintainer will ask you to link/assign the issue first.

Why this helps:
- Prevents duplicated effort (two people solving the same item at once).
- Makes it clear who owns the change and who to ask for review.
- Keeps the issue tracker meaningful (issues move to closed automatically when referenced with `Closes #N`).

Examples (PR body):

```
Closes #12

Add keyboard controls to the Snake game. This PR implements arrow keys and prevents reverse-direction input.
```

If you're a new contributor and there are no maintainers available to assign, open the issue and add a comment asking for assignment â€” maintainers will triage and assign as soon as they can.

## Code style
- Vanilla JS only. No frameworks, no bundlers.
- Keep modules small and focused.
- Favor semantic HTML and accessible markup.
- Use `assets/styles.css` tokens and utility classes where possible to keep visual consistency.

## Reporting issues
Please include:
- What you expected vs what happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or code snippets if helpful

## Code of Conduct
By participating, you agree to abide by our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
